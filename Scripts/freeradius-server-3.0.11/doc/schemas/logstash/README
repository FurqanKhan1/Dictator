Example configuration for logstash/elasticsearch
================================================

So you've got all these RADIUS logs, but how do you analyse them? What is the
easiest way to query the logs, find out when a client connected or disconnected,
or view the top ten clients logging into the system over the last six hours?

The logstash/elasticsearch/kibana stack is designed and built to do just that.
elasticsearch is a search engine; logstash is commonly used to feed data in,
and kibana the web interface to query the logs in near real time.

Installing the ELK stack is beyond the scope of this document, but can be done
in a short amount of time by any competent sysadmin. Then comes getting the
logs in.

This directory contains the following files as a starting point for feeding
RADIUS logs into elasticsearch via logstash, then sample dashboards for Kibana
to explore the data.

Files
-----

Please note that all files should be reviewed before use to determine if they
are suitable for your configuration/system, especially if you are integrating
this into an existing logstash/elasticsearch setup.

radius-mapping.sh

  Each elasticsearch index needs a mapping to describe how fields are stored.
  If one is not provided then all is not lost as elasticsearch will build one
  on the fly. However, this may not be optimal, especially for RADIUS data, as
  all fields will be analyzed making some visualisations hard or impossible
  (such as showing top N clients).

  This shell script (which just runs curl) pushes a template mapping into the
  elasticsearch cluster.

logstash-radius.conf

  A sample configuration file for logstash that parses RADIUS 'detail' files.
  It processes these by joining each record onto one line, then splitting the
  tab-delimited key-value pairs out. Some additional data is then extracted
  from certain key attributes.

  The file will need to be edited at least to set the input method: for
  experimentation the given input (stdin) may be used. If logstash is running on
  the RADIUS server then 'file' input may be appropriate, otherwise a different
  input such as log-courier or logstash-forwarder may be better to get the data
  over the network to the logstash server.

  It would be best to use an input method that can join the multiple lines of
  the detail file together and feed them to logstash as a single entry, rather
  than using the logstash multiline filter.

log-courier.conf

  An example configuration for the log-courier feeder.

kibana4-dashboard.json

  Basic RADIUS dashboard for Kibana4.

  To import the dashboard first create a new index called "radius-*" in
  Settings/Indices. Then go to Kibana's Settings page, "Objects" and "Import".
  Once imported open the "RADIUS detail" dashboard.

kibana3-dashboard.json

  Basic RADIUS dashboard for Kibana3. To import the dashboard go to Load,
  Advanced and "Choose File".


Example usage
-------------

Install mapping (only needs to be done once):
$ ./radius-mapping.sh

Feed a detail file in:
$ /path/to/logstash -f logstash-radius.conf < acct-detail

The configuration examples presented here have been tested with the
following software versions (note that elasticsearch 2.x may not yet
work with this config).

  elasticsearch 1.7.4
  logstash 1.4.5
  kibana 4.1.2
  kibana 3.1.0
