Installation procedure

The preferred Java version to run DAV Explorer is Java 2 (JDK 1.2 and above.)
DAV Explorer also runs with JDK 1.1.8 and Swing 1.1.1. However, this may
restrict the capabilities of DAV Explorer.

Note: If not compiling from source, skip steps 1-3 and 5.
If use of SSL is not required, step 4 can also be skipped.

1. Login to the DAV Explorer Subversion archive with any Subversion client.
   The Subversion archive is located at
   http://louvre.ics.uci.edu:8080/svn/DAVExplorer/
   NOTE: the archive location may change in the near future, so be sure to check
   the DAV Explorer download website http://www.ics.uci.edu/~webdav/download.html
   for any changes.

2. Navigate to your chosen source directory.

3. Retrieve all DAV Explorer source files from the DAV Explorer Subversion
   archive, from the trunk directory, using your favorite Subversion client tool.
   The command line format:
   svn checkout http://louvre.ics.uci.edu:8080/svn/DAVExplorer/trunk DAVExplorer

4. If SSL support is required, retrieve the Java Secure Socket Extensions from
   http://java.sun.com/products/jsse/
   Install the JSSE files according to the JSSE documentation.
   Note that from JDK 1.4 on, JSSE is included in the JDK.
   Make sure that the appropriate X.509 certificates are installed at the
   Webserver.

5. Compile all Java source files with Java 2 by running make in the dav_explorer
   directory directly below your source directory. This also creates a
   DAVExplorer.jar file in the dav_explorer directory.
   The DAV Explorer sources do not compile without the JSSE files present.
   Note that the Makefile does not work under MS Windows. Instead, running the
   make.bat file in the dav_explorer directory achieves the same result.
   Under MS Windows, you can also run the DAVjar.bat file from the dav_explorer
   directory to create the DAVExplorer.jar file.
   Under Unix, the DAVjar.sh shell script serves the same purpose.
   We also provide an Eclipse workspace file in the source distribution.

6. Run the DAV Explorer.
   Under MS Windows, run the DAVExplorer.bat file from the dav_explorer directory.
   Under Unix, run the DAVExplorer.sh shell script from the dav_explorer directory.
   You can also run DAVExplorer by using the command 'java -jar DAVExplorer.jar'.
   For SSL support, run DAVExplorerSSL.bat or DAVExplorerSSL.sh, respectively.
   Alternatively, the command 'java -jar -Dssl=true DAVExplorer.jar' can be used.
   SSL support can also be selected from the Edit menu.
   Under MacOS 9, you can use the provided MRJ wrapper DAVExplorer.bin.
